# CRONOPETE

A backup utility for Linux.

Cronopete is a backup utility for Linux, modeled after Apple's
Time Machine. It aims to simplify the creation of periodic
backups.

## BUILDING CRONOPETE

To build Cronopete, you need to install CMAKE and Vala-0.20

Now, type

    mkdir BUILD
    cd BUILD
    cmake ..
    make
    sudo make install

This will compile Cronopete with AppIndicator support.

There is one modifier for "cmake" that allows to change the compilation
options:

    NO_APPINDICATOR will compile cronopete without the libappindicator library

This modifier must be prepended with "-D", and appended with "=on".
To use this modifier, first remove all the contents in the BUILD folder,
and run again cmake. This will compile cronopete without libappindicator
library:

    cd BUILD
    rm -rf *
    cmake .. -DNO_APPINDICATOR=on
    make
    sudo make install
